                Painting, the expression of ideas and emotions, with the creation of certain aesthetic qualities, in a two-dimensional
                visual language. 
                <br>
                The elements of this language—its shapes, lines, colours, tones, and textures—are used in various ways
                to produce sensations of volume, space, movement, and light on a flat surface. 
                <br>
                These elements are combined into expressive patterns in order to represent real or supernatural phenomena, to interpret a narrative theme, or to create
                wholly abstract visual relationships.
